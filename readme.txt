This plugin also allows transforming the media, adding text, orbiting, supports mobile and VR devices and more.

Specify a text label, orbiting, variable Field of View, Rotation, Resizing and more for your 360 degree image or video.

== Installation ==
If you're using wordpress.com or configured plugins installation via Wordpress web UI then

* go to the Wordpress admin console
* go to Plugins->Add New
* search for "Wordpress VR"
* Click "Install Now"
* Click "Activate"

If you're self-hosting Wordpress or prefer to install the plugins from the command line

* go to /wp-content/plugins
* download the plugin .zip file (use wget or curl) into the plugins directory
* unzip the file (and delete the .zip file if you want to)
* go to Wordpress admin interface
* go to Plugins
* locate "Wordpress VR"
* click "Activate"

== Screenshots ==
1. Fully compatible with Wordpress Gutenberg Editor.
2. Embed your 360-degree image into your text just like a regular image. Great for storytelling!
3. Place multiple 360-degree images next to each other and sync their viewports. Great for comparing two points of view on a mobile device with full motion tracking!
4. Arrange multiple 360-degree views any way you want. Great for seeing multiple places simultaneously!
5. Tons of shortcode parameters to display the images and label them exactly the way you want.
6. Embed your 360-degree videos just as easily as the photos. Format and place them in the post as easily as regular media.
7. Works as a shortcode in the text, shortcode block, code editor, gutenberg visual editor or as a combination of any of these modes.
